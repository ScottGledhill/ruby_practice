# You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares.
#  And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square
#   building blocks!
#   However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead,
#  you end up with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things!
#   If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vainâ€¦
#   Wait! That's it! You just have to check if your number of building blocks
#   is a perfect square.
